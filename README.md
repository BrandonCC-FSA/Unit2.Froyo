# Unit2.Froyo

Froyo
As you pick out a flavor at your favorite local frozen yogurt shop, you overhear the management team discussing how they would like a way for customers to order online. You make small talk and offer your services to help them build a web app.

Instructions
Build a website according to this user story:

Upon opening the website, a visitor receives a prompt to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. In the browser console, they are able to see how many of each flavor they have ordered. In this case, they observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry.

There is no starter code for this workshop, but you are encouraged to review the solutions to previous workshops! Use the rubric in Canvas to guide you.
